# Semaphore-Minix
Operating System Project


Callnhr have all the system call /n
mysemaphore.h have the api for the user
misc.c have the core of the semaphore functions
table.c map the call with the proto function.
proto.h have the prototype of the function
cake.c, read.c, write.c are test, for concurrency you can compile read.c and write.c and then in the console ./read.out & write.out will execute both in concurrency.
